•	DESCRIPTION-
While using shower many times we unknowingly use too much water so in this project user first need to input the amount of water and after he/she has used the feeded amount of water the valve automatically gets closed for 30 sec.This 30 sec gap tells the user about the usage.
This system will prevent the water wastage which is resulted due to thoughtless use of shower.
